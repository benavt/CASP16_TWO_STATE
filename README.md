- Creates special highlighting for AF3-server (group 304) with optional star markers
- Saves detailed CSV outputs with TSBI scoring information
- Handles the same targets and score types as the standard two-state processor

**TSBI Score Calculation:**
The TSBI score combines performance and balance using the following mathematical formula:

```
TSBI = Balance × (V1_ref + V2_ref)
```

Where:
- **Balance** = 1 - |V1_ref - V2_ref| / (V1_ref + V2_ref)
- **V1_ref** = Best score using V1 reference state
- **V2_ref** = Best score using V2 reference state

**Mathematical Properties:**
- **Balance factor** ranges from 0 to 1:
  - **Balance = 1**: Perfect balance (V1_ref = V2_ref)
  - **Balance = 0**: Maximum imbalance (one reference state has score 0)
- **TSBI = 0**: When either V1_ref or V2_ref equals 0
- **TSBI = -1**: Special case indicating insufficient data for calculation

**Advantages of TSBI:**
- Rewards groups that perform consistently across both reference states
- Penalizes groups with highly imbalanced performance
- Provides a single metric that captures both overall performance and consistency
- Useful for identifying robust prediction methods

**Targets and Score Types Processed:**
- **M1228**: BestDockQ, GDT_TS, GlobDockQ, GlobalLDDT, TMscore
