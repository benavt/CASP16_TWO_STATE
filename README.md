  - adjustText
  - tqdm

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib adjustText tqdm
```

## Script Overview and Usage

### 1. `process_two_state_score.py`
**Purpose**: Processes the gathered data to compute two-state scores for each target and score type, generates summary CSVs in `OUTPUT/`, and creates scatter and bar plots in `PLOTS/`.

**Usage:**
```bash
python process_two_state_score.py
```

**What it does:**
- Automatically processes all targets and score types defined in `TARGET_SCORE_DICT`
- Computes two-state scores by combining the best scores from different model/version combinations
- Generates scatter plots comparing V1 vs V2 reference states
- Creates stacked bar charts showing combined scores
- Saves detailed CSV outputs with all scoring information
- Handles special cases for different targets (M1228, M1239, R1203, T1214, T1228, T1239, T1249)

**Targets and Score Types Processed:**
- **M1228**: BestDockQ, GDT_TS, GlobDockQ, GlobalLDDT, TMscore
- **M1239**: BestDockQ, GDT_TS, GlobDockQ, GlobalLDDT, TMscore
- **R1203**: GDT_TS, GlobalLDDT, Composite_Score_4, TMscore
- **T1214**: GDT_TS, GlobalLDDT, TMscore, Composite_Score_4
- **T1228**: GDT_TS, GlobalLDDT, TMscore
- **T1239**: GDT_TS, GlobalLDDT, TMscore
- **T1249**: AvgDockQ, GlobalLDDT, GDT_TS, TMscore

### 2. `process_single_state_score.py`
**Purpose**: Processes single-state scores for targets that only have one reference state (currently T1214).

**Usage:**
```bash
python process_single_state_score.py
```

**What it does:**
- Processes targets that don't have V1/V2 reference state comparisons
- Generates single-state scoring analysis
- Creates appropriate visualizations for single-state data
- Currently configured for T1214 with GDT_TS, GlobalLDDT, TMscore, and Composite_Score_4

### 3. `create_latex_tables.py`
**Purpose**: Generates LaTeX table files from the processed CSV outputs for publication purposes.

**Usage:**
```bash
python create_latex_tables.py
```

**What it does:**
- Reads all CSV files from the `OUTPUT/` directory
- Converts them to properly formatted LaTeX tables
- Handles special formatting for publication (decimal places, underscores, etc.)
- Creates a special T1214 Sigma4 score table
- Saves all tables to the `LATEX_TABLES/` directory

### 4. `process_two_state_score_TSBI.py`
**Purpose**: Processes two-state scores with TSBI (Two-State Balance Index) calculation, providing a balanced assessment metric that considers both performance and consistency across reference states.

**Usage:**
```bash
python process_two_state_score_TSBI.py
```

**What it does:**
- Automatically processes all targets and score types defined in `TARGET_SCORE_DICT`
- Computes TSBI scores that balance performance with consistency across V1 and V2 reference states
- Generates horizontal and vertical bar plots showing TSBI scores for each group
- Creates special highlighting for AF3-server (group 304) with optional star markers
- Saves detailed CSV outputs with TSBI scoring information
- Handles the same targets and score types as the standard two-state processor

**TSBI Score Calculation:**
The TSBI score combines performance and balance using the following mathematical formula:

```
TSBI = Balance × (V1_ref + V2_ref)
```

Where:
- **Balance** = 1 - |V1_ref - V2_ref| / (V1_ref + V2_ref)
- **V1_ref** = Best score using V1 reference state
- **V2_ref** = Best score using V2 reference state

**Mathematical Properties:**
- **Balance factor** ranges from 0 to 1:
  - **Balance = 1**: Perfect balance (V1_ref = V2_ref)
  - **Balance = 0**: Maximum imbalance (one reference state has score 0)
- **TSBI = 0**: When either V1_ref or V2_ref equals 0
- **TSBI = -1**: Special case indicating insufficient data for calculation

**Advantages of TSBI:**
- Rewards groups that perform consistently across both reference states
- Penalizes groups with highly imbalanced performance
- Provides a single metric that captures both overall performance and consistency
- Useful for identifying robust prediction methods

**Targets and Score Types Processed:**
- **M1228**: BestDockQ, GDT_TS, GlobDockQ, GlobalLDDT, TMscore
- **M1239**: BestDockQ, GDT_TS, GlobDockQ, GlobalLDDT, TMscore
- **R1203**: GDT_TS, GlobalLDDT, Composite_Score_4, TMscore
- **T1214**: GDT_TS, GlobalLDDT, TMscore, Composite_Score_4
- **T1228**: GDT_TS, GlobalLDDT, TMscore
- **T1239**: GDT_TS, GlobalLDDT, TMscore
- **T1249**: AvgDockQ, GlobalLDDT, GDT_TS, TMscore

## Complete Workflow

1. **Process Two-State Scores:**
   ```bash
   python process_two_state_score.py
   ```

2. **Process Two-State Scores with TSBI:**
   ```bash
   python process_two_state_score_TSBI.py
   ```

3. **Process Single-State Scores (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   python process_single_state_score.py
   ```

4. **Generate LaTeX Tables:**
   ```bash
   python create_latex_tables.py
   ```

- **Special features**: AF3 baseline highlighting, inset zoom regions for specific targets

### TSBI Plots (`TSBI_PLOTS/` directory)
- **TSBI bar plots**: Horizontal and vertical bar charts showing TSBI scores for each group
- **AF3 highlighting**: Special highlighting for group 304 (AF3) with optional star markers
- **Multiple variants**: Star and no-star versions for both horizontal and vertical orientations

### LaTeX Tables (`LATEX_TABLES/` directory)
- Publication-ready LaTeX tables for all processed data
- Proper formatting and escaping for academic publication
- Special T1214 Sigma4 score table

## Special Features

- **AF3 Baseline Highlighting**: Special highlighting for group 304 (AF3) in relevant plots
- **Inset Zoom Regions**: Detailed zoom views for specific target/score combinations
- **Dynamic Plot Sizing**: Automatic adjustment of plot dimensions based on number of groups
- **Group Name Mapping**: Automatic conversion of group numbers to human-readable names
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for missing data or processing issues

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Data Files**: Ensure data files exist in the `DATA/` directory
- **Missing Dependencies**: Install required Python packages using the pip command above
- **File Path Issues**: Ensure the script is run from the `CASP_DATA_PROCESSING/` directory
- **Memory Issues**: For large datasets, consider processing targets individually
